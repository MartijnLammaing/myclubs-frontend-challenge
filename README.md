# myclubs frontend challenge

## about

this is a small challenge to assess your frontend dev skills. you should invest no more than 2 hours in completing it. the instructions contain all the information you should have, everything else is up to your own judgement. there is now right or wrong solution, only your own approach. feel free to use any library, boilerplate, tool etc ... that you like. don't be afraid to use easy / convenient solutions. we are as much interessted in your reasoning as we are in the result, during the call we would like you to say a few words about your work.

## deliverable

fork this repository and submit you result as pull request. one should be able to run it, by cloning your repo and running.

```
npm install 
npm start
